My Personal Website
This code encapsulates a personal website of mine, containing my work, interests, and links to important documents/social
data/contacts. The site also contains Docs in reference to prior projects (code will be supplied in due time), interests/proofs
in Mathematics, and work in the Latin Language/Classical Civ. 
This project was completed using HTML/CSS, and will be hosted by a goDaddy domain/hosting service.
