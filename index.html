    <p style="font-family:Courier New;"> <img src= "ezgif.com-gif-maker.gif" alt= "Coding gif" style="width:400px;height:200px;float:right;">
        Hi! My name is Peter Koncelik, and I am currently a sophomore at Vanderbilt University studying Computer Science,
        Applied Mathematics, and Classics. I have experience in full-stack development, having used front-end tools such as HTML/CSS and React.js,
        extensive back-end development work in Node.js and SQL Server, and general-purpose proramming in Java, JavaScript, and C++. 
        My passion for Mathematics ignites my curiosity in the intersection of Applied Mathematics, Data Analytics and
        Software Development. I also have an extensive interest in the world of Classical Rome and the Latin
        language. Below, you will see some of my work in these areas, my interests, and contact information. Other information,
        including past/present employment, extracurriculur involvement, etc. can be found on my resume below.
    </p>
    <br>
    
    <h2 style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:16px;">Work Experience</h2>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New;">In addition to the projects below and my Computer Science courses in school, I worked as a Software Developer
    Intern for MTD Products on the E-Commerce team in the Summer of 2019. Working across the Full Stack with a variety of tools, my projects primarily 
    focused on both enhancements to preexisting client services within the MTD Products software base, as well as wholly-new projects aimed at benefitting 
    the entire MTD Corporate IT branch. All work below primarily made use of Node.js, JavaScript, React.js, SQL Server, Oracle Database, XML/JSON Data formats: </p>
    <ul style="font-family:Courier New;">
        <li>Developing a client enhancement that sent out emails for errant orders in the online order system in an orderly manner, tracking order issues using a personal database.</li>
        <li>Engineered an npm-installable module that loads configuration data into a triplet map data structure for constant-time access and intuitive data organization</li>
        <!-- Link to this module!-->
        <li>Enhanced the MTD products front-end web service with two synchronizoing applications that kept the XML master catalog up to date with online product listings, specifically for replacement parts and Epcot order service</li>
        <li>Developed the base for a front-to back, full-stack order lookup hub for the entire MTD order process to track orders as they progress through the order process and encounter errors for easy correction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:16px;">My Projects</h2>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New;"> Below are README descriptions of the various projects I have worked on. <br>
        Their source code will be posted on a respectively linked GitHub in due time.</p>
    <ul style="font-family:Courier New;">
        <li>Software allowing the operation of DNA <a href="DNAStrand.txt" target="_blank">Sequences</a></li>
        <li>Guitar simulation/composition <a href="READMEOLD7.txt" target="_blank">Software</a></li>
        <ul>
            <li>I used it to make my own composition of the beginning of Mozart's "Marriage of Fiagro":</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Composition written as a <a href="song.txt" target="_blank"> .txt file</a></li>
                <li>Program's conversion of .txt file into<a href="Figaro.dat" target="_blank"> .dat file</a></li>
                <li>Sound file of final song after conversion into <a href="Figaro.wav" target="_blank">.wav file</a></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Fully functional, user-friendly Boggle <a href="README10 copy.txt" target="_blank">Game</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New;">I am also devloping a web application using C++ (May be ported to JavaScript) and a React.js frontend UI 
        that can scan lines of Latin poetry. The process of Latin scansion is often a complex, tedious, and difficult one. It is my hope that this
        application will streamline the process for Latin students, who can instead focus on translation and interpretation rather than the 
        tedium of scansion.

    <h2 style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:16px;">Interests/Study in Mathematics</h2>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New;">My study in Mathematics is relatively diverse, but I have a preference for Calculus and Differential Equations <br>
    Below is some of the things I've done/found interesting in my study of mathematics (Note: Personal, handwritten completions of these proofs will be added soon):
    <ul style="font-family:Courier New;"> <!-- Add Links to these Lines! -->
        <li>Proof of the Orthogonality Principle for Legendre's Equation</li>
        <li>Proof of the unit-based functionality of the Dirac-Delta Function</li>
        <li>The Butterfly Effect with respect to Differential Equations (I don't understand it, but I think its really cool)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Here is an interesting <a href= "https://fs.blog/2017/08/the-butterfly-effect/" target="_blank">article</a> on its generalities</li>
        </ul>
    </ul></p>

    <br>
    <h2 style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:16px;">Latin and Classical Rome</h2>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New;">My additional academic "passion project" is Ancient Rome and the Latin Language: Having studied them
    throughout my high school and college years, I find Rome's history, politics, language, culture, and their contemporary
    relevance and influence to be fascinating. I have studied Roman history and culture, and have read original Latin
    texts of Caesar's Commentaries, "The Aeneid," and the Satires of Horace and Juvenal. Below is some of my work in these areas. </p>
    <ul style="font-family:Courier New;">
        <li>This Latin <a href="Mea Satura.pdf" target="_blank">Satire</a> I composed, with accompanying commentary and translation</li>
        <li>This historical <a href="Summus Potens Caesari.pdf" target="_blank"> analysis</a> of Julius Caesar's rise to power</li>
        <li>This artistic <a href="Ara Pacis Augustae.pdf" target="_blank"> interpretation</a> of Augustus Caesar's "Ara Pacis"</li>
    </ul>
