        Hi! My name is Peter Koncelik, and I am currently a sophomore at Vanderbilt University studying Computer Science,
        Applied Mathematics, and Classics. I have experience in front-end application development in Java, C++, and HTML/CSS,
        while my passion for Mathematics ignites my curiosity in the intersection of Applied Mathematics, Data Analytics and
        Software Development. I also have an extensive interest in the world of Classical Rome and the Latin
        language. Below, you will see some of my work in these areas, my interests, and contact information. Other information,
        including past/present employment, extracurriculur involvement, etc. can be found on my resume below.
    </p>

    <h2 style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:16px;">My Projects</h2>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New;"> Below are README descriptions of the various projects I have worked on. <br>
        Their source code will be posted on a respectively linked GitHub in due time.</p>
    <ul style="font-family:Courier New;">
        <li>Software allowing the operation of DNA <a href="DNAStrand.txt" target="_blank">Sequences</a></li>
        <li>Guitar simulation/composition <a href="READMEOLD7.txt" target="_blank">Software</a></li>
        <ul>
            <li>I used it to make my own composition of the beginning of Mozart's "Marriage of Fiagro:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Composition written as a <a href="song.txt" target="_blank"> .txt file</a></li>
                <li>Program's conversion of .txt file into<a href="Figaro.dat" target="_blank"> .dat file</a></li>
                <li>Sound file of final song after conversion into <a href="Figaro.wav" target="_blank">.wav file</a></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>Fully functional, user-friendly Boggle <a href="README10 copy.txt" target="_blank">Game</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New;">I am also slowly developing an iOS application using Swift/JS/C++ Source Code.
    The application will be a steadily-refining search algorithm, tentatively called PlayWhat?, that will locate a set of board games
    to play based on specific criteria provided by the user. This criteria will include playtime, theme, complexity, etc.
    To learn more about my hobby of boardgaming that inspired this project, visit <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com" target="_blank">this site.</a><br>

    <h2 style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:16px;">Interests/Study in Mathematics</h2>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New;">My study in Mathematics is relatively diverse, but I have a preference for Calculus and Differential Equations <br>
    Below is some of the things I've done/found interesting in my study of mathematics (Note: Personal, handwritten completions of these proofs will be added soon):
    <ul style="font-family:Courier New;"> <!-- Add Links to these Lines! -->
        <li>Proof of the Orthogonality Principle for Legendre's Equation</li>
        <li>Proof of the unit-based functionality of the Dirac-Delta Function</li>
        <li>The Butterfly Effect with respect to Differential Equations (I don't understand it, but I think its really cool)</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Here is an interesting <a href= "https://fs.blog/2017/08/the-butterfly-effect/" target="_blank">article</a> on its generalities</li>
        </ul>
    </ul></p>

    <br>
    <h2 style="font-family:Courier New;font-size:16px;">Latin and Classical Rome</h2>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New;">My additional academic "passion project" is Ancient Rome and the Latin Language: Having studied them
    throughout my high school and college years, I find Rome's history, politics, language, culture, and their contemporary
    relevance and influence to be fascinating. I have studied Roman history and culture, and have read original Latin
    texts of Caesar's Commentaries, "The Aeneid," and the Satires of Horace and Juvenal. Below is some of my work in these areas. </p>
    <ul style="font-family:Courier New;">
        <li>This Latin <a href="Mea Satura.pdf" target="_blank">Satire</a> I composed, with accompanying commentary and translation</li>
        <li>This historical <a href="Summus Potens Caesari.pdf" target="_blank"> analysis</a> of Julius Caesar's rise to power</li>
        <li>This artistic <a href="Ara Pacis Augustae.pdf" target="_blank"> interpretation</a> of Augustus Caesar's "Ara Pacis"</li>
    </ul>
