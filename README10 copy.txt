PA10 README File

This program simulates a Boggle Game, making use of the offical Boggle Player's dictionary and following Boggle Scoring Rules.
It allows the user to play against the computer and sees who scores the most. The comuter finds every word on any given 4x4 Boggle Board
by using a recursive backtracking algorithm and matching found words with the predetermined dictionary-lexicon. The program's functionality
was exteneded by allowing the user to play against the computer, verifying that the user's words are in fact present on the Boggle Board using
another recursive backtracking solver, and tracking and displaying the final Boggle Scores for both the computer and the user.

Code written in C++ will eventually be posted and made visible. In the mean time, a visualization of its output will be provided in its stead.
