DNA Strand Manipulation Class

This software was created with the intention of use in a laboratory environent varying from biology to genetics. The class allows for the storage and manipulation of large and complex DNA Strand sequences, based upon its 4 nucleobasic compositions: adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. 

Specifically, functionality includes the storage and nomenclature of extended molecules. In terms of manipulation, the class allows DNA Strands to be:
1. Grown and shrunk with appending sequences on the end of preexisting strands.
2. Cleaved between repeated, like pairs of repeated strand sequences, mimicking the removal and reassembly of DNA Strands post-cleavage.
3. Spliced, allowing the insertion of a desired strand in between multiple occurrences of a user-specified sequence of DNA.
4. Tracked, by counting the repeat occurrences of either the 4 nucleobases, or of a user-specified DNA sequence. 

This software made use of C++ and will be posted to GitHub, along with extended user functionaliy, shortly.
